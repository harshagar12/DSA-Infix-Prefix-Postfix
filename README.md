# DSA-Infix-Prefix-Postfix
Overview:
This is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that converts infix expressions into postfix or prefix notation. The application allows users to input an infix expression and choose between converting it to postfix or prefix format. The steps of the conversion are displayed in the interface, along with the final result.

Features:
Infix to Postfix Conversion: Convert infix expressions to postfix notation using the stack-based algorithm.
Infix to Prefix Conversion: Convert infix expressions to prefix notation.
Real-time display: View the intermediate steps of the conversion process, such as the current character, operator stack, and expression stack.
Toggle Between Postfix and Prefix: The user can toggle between postfix and prefix conversion using a checkbox.
User-friendly GUI: A clean and simple interface using Tkinter for easy interaction.

Usage Instructions:
Input Field: Enter the infix expression in the input field.
Postfix/Prefix Checkbox: Check the "Postfix" option to convert to postfix notation or uncheck it to convert to prefix notation.
Submit Button: After entering the expression and selecting the desired conversion, click the "Submit" button to begin the conversion process.

Outputs:
Current Character: Displays the current character being processed.
Symbol Stack: Shows the state of the operator stack at each step.
Expression Stack: Displays the expression stack at each step.
Final Output: Displays the final postfix or prefix expression.
